    "India is quite famous for its diverse multi cuisine available in a large number of restaurants and hotel resorts, which is reminiscent of unity in diversity. Restaurant business in India is always evolving. More Indians are warming up to the idea of eating restaurant food whether by dining outside or getting food delivered.

So, this project focuses on analysing the Zomato restaurant data for each city in India.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Project focuses on Customers and Company, you have  to analyze the sentiments of the reviews given by the customer in the data and made some useful conclusion in the form of Visualizations.
